# VeVe
working with veve data

-------------
MCP CALCULTOR
-------------

Item data from Butt Thompson's famous market tables with two corrections:
- Amazing Spider-Man comic names were adjusted to match for the series
- Fixed typo in Captain Carter

With advice from Jeomite


HOW-TO:
1. Enter your comics and collectibles in the green tabs - MUST use the exact name
    The sheet will auto-populate the rarity, set/series, and points for you!
3. Enter your series and sets manually by copying the text from column A - they MUST match column A
4. See the final daily points on the first tab (MCP)
5. Optionally: enter a second collection to compare what would happen if you made some moves using the blue tabs (collection 2)
a. At your own risk, the sheet passwords are "VeVe" if you want to edit!


Under Consideration:
- Add serial number for low mint count
- Add drop/market purchase flag for one-time points
